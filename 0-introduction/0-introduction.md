# Workshop: Enhance Guest Experience with OCI Generative AI

This workshop focuses on using **OCI Generative AI services** to enhance guest experiences and streamline hotel operations.  

You will assume the role of **Maria**, the General Manager of a hotel, who receives daily multilingual reviews from guests. The workshop will guide you on how to leverage AI to:  
- Summarize reviews  
- Analyze guest sentiment  
- Translate feedback into English  

This enables quick and effective responses that improve guest satisfaction.

The workshop is divided into two parts:

### **Lab 1: Enhance Guest Experience with OCI Generative AI**

In this lab, you will:  
- Use the **OCI Generative AI Playground**. 
- Work with a sample non-English review.

This task demonstrates how AI saves time while improving **accuracy** and **scalability** in handling guest reviews.

### **Lab 2:** 
**(a) Build an Agentic Hotel Concierge**.

- Enable the concierge to identify patterns and respond to queries about the **entire guest feedback knowledge base**.  

         
**(b) Build a Data-Driven Concierge to Solve Problems in Real Time with OCI ADK**
In this lab, you will:
