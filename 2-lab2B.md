# Lab 2B: Building an Agentic Hotel Concierge - With ADK using tools and RAG??


## Introduction

This lab walks you through the step-by-step creation of an **AI Concierge** directly in the OCI Console, covering the knowledge base, agent, and tools configuration. This method is recommended if you want a deeper understanding of the underlying components and their relationships. If you prefer a faster setup using a Python script to provision all components automatically, check out [Lab 2A: Automated Deployment](2-lab2A.md)

<!--Watch this short video introducing Maria's AI Concierge and the problem it solves:
![Maria's AI Concierge](videos/maria_ai_concierge_intro.mp4)-->

Three months after implementing her **AI review analysis system**, Maria, General Manager of the Grand Plaza Hotel, can now quickly understand and respond to guest reviews in multiple languages, greatly improving **guest satisfaction ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê** and **response times ‚è±Ô∏è**. A new challenge arose: identifying **patterns across complaints** like *noisy construction*, *slow Wi-Fi*, or *event disruptions*. Manually tracking these across spreadsheets and review platforms is *slow* and *error-prone*.

The solution is an **AI Concierge üõéÔ∏è** using **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** that can *instantly search thousands of reviews*, *identify trends*, *provide context-aware responses*, and *solve real-time issues*. Maria can now ask the AI questions like **"How many guests reported Wi-Fi issues this month?"** or **"What event disrupted guests last weekend?"** and get instant insights.


### **Objectives**

In this lab, you will build the AI Concierge  using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and  complete four main tasks:  
1. Upload the TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews dataset to Object Storage
2. Create a Knowledge Base in Generative AI Agents
3. Create and Test your First Agent with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
4. Run the Problem-Solving Concierge using the OCI Agent Development Kit (ADK)

## üìã Task 1: Upload Dataset to Object Storage

1. Navigate to the **OCI Console** ‚Üí **Storage** ‚Üí **Object Storage & Archive Storage**.  
   ![Step 1: Navigate to Object Storage](images/object-storage-navigation.png)

2. Create a new bucket:  
   - **Bucket Name:** `ai-workshop-labs-datasets`  
   ![Step 2: Create a Bucket](images/create-bucket.png)

3. Upload the dataset file into the bucket:  
   - File: `tripadvisor_hotel_reviews.csv`  
   ![Step 3: Upload Dataset](images/upload-dataset.png)

**At the end of this task, the dataset will be securely stored in Object Storage.**

## üìã Task 2: Create a Knowledge Base in Generative AI Agents

The **Knowledge Base** will act as the repository for your dataset (hotel reviews).

1. Navigate to the **OCI Console** ‚Üí **Analytics & AI** ‚Üí **AI Services** ‚Üí **Generative AI Agents**.  
   ![Step 1: Navigate to Generative AI Agents](images/genai-agents-navigation.png)

2. In the left-hand menu, click **Knowledge Bases** ‚Üí **Create knowledge base**.  
   ![Step 2: Create Knowledge Base](images/create-knowledge-base.png)

3. Fill in the details:  
   - **Name:** `Hotel_Reviews_KB`  
   - **Compartment:** Select your working compartment  
   - **Data Store Type:** Object Storage  

   ![Step 3: Fill Knowledge Base Details](images/kb-details.png)

4. Under **Data Sources**, add the Object Storage bucket you created:  
   - **Name:** `HotelReviews-Reviews-DataSource`  
   - **Bucket:** `ai-workshop-labs-datasets`  
   - **Enable Auto Ingestion:** ‚úîÔ∏è (Check this to auto-ingest new files)  

   ![Step 4: Configure Data Source](images/kb-datasource.png)

5. Click **Create knowledge base**.  
   Data ingestion will begin automatically.  

   ![Step 5: Knowledge Base Created](images/kb-created.png)

 **At the end of this task, you will have a Knowledge Base linked to your dataset in Object Storage.**

## üìã Task 3: Create and Test the First Agent

> **Note:** If you ran the setup scripts, skip to step 3.

### Step 1: Create the Agent with RAG Tool
1. In the **Generative AI Agents** console, click **Agents** ‚Üí **Create agent**.  
   ![Step 1: Navigate to Create Agent](images/create-agent.png)

2. Fill in the details:  
   - **Name:** `Hotel_Concierge_Agent`  
   ![Step 2: Fill Agent Details](images/agent-details.png)

3. Click **Next**.  
   - Select **Add tool** ‚Üí **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
   - Choose the Knowledge Base you created earlier: `Hotel_Reviews_KB`.  

   ![Step 3: Select RAG Tool](images/select-rag.png)

---

### Step 2: Create an Endpoint
1. On the next screen, select:  
   - **Automatically create an endpoint for this agent** ‚úîÔ∏è  
   (This is essential for the ADK to connect later.)  
   ![Step 4: Create Endpoint](images/create-endpoint.png)

2. Click **Next**, then **Create agent**.  
   ![Step 5: Agent Created](images/agent-created.png)

---

### Step 3: Chat with and Test Your RAG Agent
1. Once the agent is active, click **Launch chat**.  
   ![Step 6: Launch Chat](images/launch-chat.png)

2. Test its knowledge from the dataset with sample queries:  
   - *‚ÄúSummarize the most common positive comments people make about their rooms.‚Äù*  
   - *‚ÄúAre there any negative reviews that mention the check-in process?‚Äù*  

   ![Step 7: Test Chat](images/test-chat.png)

**At the end of this task, you will have created an agent with RAG and validated that it can retrieve and summarize information from your Knowledge Base.**

## üìù Task 4: The Problem-Solving Concierge (Live Tool with OCI ADK)

This part moves from the **OCI Console** to your **local machine** to run the Python script. *(~15 minutes)*

> **Note:** If you ran the setup scripts, skip to step 3.

### Step 1: Create the Agent with RAG Tool
1. In the **Generative AI Agents** console, click **Agents** ‚Üí **Create agent**.  
   ![Step 1: Navigate to Create Agent](images/create-agent.png)

2. Fill in the details:  
   - **Name:** `Hotel_Concierge_Agent_ADK`  
   ![Step 2: Fill Agent ADK Details](images/agent-adk-details.png)

3. Click **Next**.  
   - Select **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** as the tool.  

   ![Step 3: Select RAG Tool](images/select-rag.png)

---

### Step 2: Create an Endpoint
1. On the next screen, select:  
   - **Automatically create an endpoint for this agent** ‚úîÔ∏è  
   ![Step 4: Create Endpoint](images/create-endpoint.png)

2. Click **Next**, then **Create agent**.  
   ![Step 5: Agent Created](images/agent-created.png)

---

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
1. Open the **GitHub repository** you cloned earlier in your text editor.  
   ![Step 6: Open Repo](images/open-repo.png)

2. Copy the example environment file:  
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file and update the placeholders:  
   - Replace `<replace with your knowledge base id>` with your **Knowledge Base OCID**  
   - Replace `<replace with your agent endpoint id>` with your **Agent Endpoint OCID**  
   - Replace `<replace with your tavily api key>` with your **Tavily AI API key**  

   ![Step 7: Update ENV](images/update-env.png)

---

### Step 4: Run the Agent
1. From your terminal, execute the script:  
   ```bash
   python run_concierge_agent.py
   ```

2. The script will:  
   - Connect to your existing agent  
   - Run `agent.setup()` to synchronize tools  
   - Detect the new **web_search tool** in your code  
   - Add it to your agent‚Äôs capabilities (without removing the RAG tool)  
   - Execute a query and print the **final response**  

   ![Step 8: Run Agent Script](images/run-agent.png)

‚úÖ **At the end of this task, you will have a live, problem-solving concierge agent running locally with the OCI ADK.**
