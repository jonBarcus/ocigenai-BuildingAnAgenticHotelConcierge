# Lab 2A: Building an Agentic Hotel Concierge - Automated Deployment



## Introduction

This lab guides you through creating an **AI Concierge**.  In this version, we use a Python script to quickly create all the necessary components (agent, knowledge base, and tools) automatically.If you‚Äôd like to understand how to build everything manually through the OCI Console, please refer to [Lab 2B: Manual Console Creation](2-lab2B.md)

Three months after implementing her **AI review analysis system**, Maria, General Manager of the Grand Plaza Hotel, can now quickly understand and respond to guest reviews in multiple languages, greatly improving **guest satisfaction ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê** and **response times ‚è±Ô∏è**. A new challenge arose: identifying **patterns across complaints** like *noisy construction*, *slow Wi-Fi*, or *event disruptions*. Manually tracking these across spreadsheets and review platforms is *slow* and *error-prone*.

The solution is an **AI Concierge üõéÔ∏è** using **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** that can *instantly search thousands of reviews*, *identify trends*, *provide context-aware responses*, and *solve real-time issues*. Maria can now ask the AI questions like **"How many guests reported Wi-Fi issues this month?"** or **"What event disrupted guests last weekend?"** and get instant insights.


### **Objectives**

In this lab, you will build the AI Concierge  using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and  complete four main tasks:  
1. run a script to upload dataset, create KnowledgeBase and agent
2. Create and Test your First Agent with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
3. Run the Problem-Solving Concierge using the OCI Agent Development Kit (ADK)

## Step 1: Run Script -- 
Run the below script to create object storage, crerate agent, 

---
## Step 2:  Test it 
Execute the provided Python file:

## Step 2:  ADK Test
Execute the provided Python file:

```bash
python setup.py
```

The script will use the ADK to provision all necessary resources in your OCI tenancy.

‚úÖ This method streamlines the setup, allowing you to proceed directly to testing the agent's functionality.
